## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our group initially choose to examine extreme weather events and their relationship to climate change as we thought with recent news it would be interesting to examine the occurrences of extreme weather and analyze frequency, duration, and intensity of these events. However, after finding our initial search requirements too vague we narrowed down our search to specifically wildfire events within the United States of America. We are hoping to examine the wildfire events and conduct analysis on topics such as: increasing/ decreasing frequency of wildfires, change in duration of wildfires with time, change in regional frequencies of wildfire events, and etc. Ultimately taking this data and creating a user friendly dashboard would be very interesting as it would allow anyone to explore the wildfire data and maybe even draw conclusions that could help a person make decisions such as where to live.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset provided by the US Department of Agriculture is collection of data on wildfires within the United States from 1980-2018. The records were gathered from Federal, state, and local fire organizations. The following information is included within the dataset: discovery date, final fire size, spatial data of the fire, cause of fire, local reports, Reporting authority, and responding authority. This data set is the 4th publication and was initially generated to assist the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system. Some precleaning of the data has occurred with basic error-checking and redundant records removed. The dataset contains over 2.16 million individual records all with geo-references which ultimately represent a burned area of 165 million acres over the twenty seven year range of the data collected.
